            <p><i>Like so many other products, jewellery sales are increasingly moving online rather than taking place in a traditional brick and mortar store. Shopping online is of course quick and convenient, plus it allows you to shop from places far away from your location.</i></p> <br>
               <p> While being able to see a piece of jewellery and trying it on in person is great, the downside is the inconvenience of needing to travel to a store and being limited to what that particular store has available. You'll also miss out on beautiful artisan jewellery created by independent designers who generally don't have bricks and mortar stores (like us!).</p> <br>
               <p>While there are plenty of upsides to shopping for jewellery online, you do need to take care and pay attention to the right things to avoid some of the pitfalls. Even if you feel like a seasoned pro when buying jewellery online, it's still a great idea to have a refresher when it comes to what to be wary of.</p>

            <p><i>Gold rings have been a much sought after jewellery accessory for millennia, with some of the oldest rings in gold found to date having been made around 6,500 years ago. The beauty, elegance, preciousness and durability of solid gold has made it an enormously popular choice for rings, right up to the present day.</i></p> <br>
            <p>Of course gold rings (as with all solid gold jewellery) are expensive, so why do people invest in them rather than more affordable metals?</p><br>
            <p>Read on to explore the benefits of owning and wearing solid gold jewellery, along with the versatility and timeless style of gold rings and the different types of gold rings that you could consider adding to your rings collection.</p> <br><br>

            <p><i>Who doesn't love the gorgeous glamour of gold jewellery? Its beautiful quality and colour make it the most sought after metal when it comes to jewellery. That said, even gold jewellery won't do much for you if you don't consider how to style it.</i></p><br>
            <p>When styling jewellery, some people make the mistake of overdoing it without panache, leaving them looking overdone - and not in a good way. Others may be too subdued and draw little if any attention to their jewellery choices. There are also those who wear the same pieces day in and day out, some of which may be lovely but they get lost in repetition (and I bet they need a good clean too!).</p><br>
            <p>When it comes to wearing gold jewellery especially, you'll really want to make the most of your investment and style it so you best when wearing it - and so that you show it off appropriately.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>CHOOSE YOUR MAIN PIECE OF JEWELLERY</h3><br>
            <p>When it comes to jewellery, you'll often want to create a focal point. In other words, you will want to find a specific area that you want others to be drawn to when they look at you. Consciously or not, this is a way of communicating something about yourself to other people, so it pays to spend some time thinking about it.</p><br>
            <p>A common mistake people make is either wearing too much jewellery in an unfocused way or wearing other jewellery that visually competes with the main piece of jewellery they want to be the focus.</p><br>
            <p>For example, if you're trying to show off a beautiful gold necklace, but also wear a huge pair of hoop earrings, people may end up looking much more at your earrings than your necklace. Even if they don't, the earrings will still be a distraction. Instead of doing this, focus on the one piece of jewellery that you really want to stand out and build the rest of your jewellery styling around it.</p>
            <p>If you want the focus to be on your earrings, considering wearing a very subtle necklace - or don't wear a necklace at all and go for delicate bracelets and rings. If the focal point will be your necklace, then wear small earrings and delicate rings.</p><br>
            <p>Likewise, you'll want to avoid too many other accessories when you are wearing jewellery or wear more simple jewellery if you want to show off an accessory instead. If a beautiful scarf is the thing you want people to focus on, then consider subtle gold earrings and rings.</p><br>
            <p>Finally, our favourite tip is to experiment with bending and breaking the rules. If you don't want to have a single focal point, then consider wearing a suite of jewellery that works beautifully together overall, perhaps because it's based on a colour, theme, repetition of design or general aesthetic.</p><br>
