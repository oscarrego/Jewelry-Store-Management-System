        <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Simplicity never goes out of style - this has been our philosophy at Electronic Gems and one of the many things that brought us together! Our frustration with the lack of this simplicity in the fine jewellery we owned made us think of Electronic Gems. All the pieces we owned were heavy, kept in our bank lockers and taken out only for special occasions. We realized this was the case with most girls in our generation and so decided to build something that every girl has most likely looked for but couldn’t find –</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bolder;" >Fine jewellery that can be worn every day, that the modern girl feels proud to own, and that doesn’t break the bank!</p>
        <br>
        <p>At Electronic Gems you will find jewellery in 18 kt gold, which is classic, minimalist and contemporary that you can enjoy wearing everyday, while dressing up or down!</p>
        <br><br><br>
